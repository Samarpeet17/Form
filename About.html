        <h2>1) Benefits of travelling – It teaches you about the world

            “The world is a book, and those who do not travel read only a page.” – said Saint Augustine. Travelling can teach you more than any university course. You learn about the culture of the country you visit. If you talk to locals, you will likely learn about their thinking, habits, traditions and history as well.</h2> <br>

            <h2>2) Benefits of travelling – It teaches you about your homeland

                If you travel, you will not only learn about foreign cultures, but about your own as well. You will notice the cultural differences, and will find out what makes your culture unique. After retrurning from a long journey, you will see your country with new eyes.</h2> <br>

                <h2>3) Benefits of travelling – It teaches you about yourself

                    You can learn a lot about yourself through travelling. You can observe how you feel beeing far from your country. You will find out how you feel about your homeland. You will realise how you really feel about foreign people. You will find out how much you know/do not know about the world. You will be able to observe how you react in completely new situations. You will test your language, orientational and social skills. You will not be the same person after returning home.</h2> <br>

                    <h2>4) Benefits of travelling – It makes you more tolerant

                        During travelling you will meet people that are very different from you. If you travel enough, you will learn to accept and appreciate these differences. Traveling makes you more open and accepting.</h2> <br>

                        <h2>5) Benefits of travelling – It provides you with unforgettable moments and experiences

                            Some of my most cherished memories are from the times when I was travelling. If you travel, you can experience things that you could never experience at home. You may see beautiful places and landscapes that do not exist where you live. You may meet people that will change your life, and your thingking. You may try activities that you have never tried before.</h2>
